Dictionary-Data-Structures
==========================
A basic structure is created which contains the addresses of nodes (the options) displayed in the introduction page. Then each successive node originating from the basic node stores the address of the next successive node so that all the information relating to that topic is displayed.
Moreover, the user has the option to go back to the main menu to traverse other options.
With our HTML editor, you can edit the HTML & also view the edited results.
The database of information from which we will read the data to be stored in tutorial is done by using Data File Handling.
